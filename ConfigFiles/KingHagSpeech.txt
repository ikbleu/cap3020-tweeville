- King: Murdering our precious darkwood trees! :::
- King: All of those darkwoods being slain and chopped into pieces. And for what, firewood? The pathetic need to be “warm” through this glorious winter? Villainous! :::
- King: Old Hag, how can this pathetic excuse for a human hope to overthrow us? Certainly, his slaughtering of our sacred trees is nothing short of treason, but how could he be of any threat? :::
- Old Hag: I have foreseen it. This boy will begin a journey to overrun both the empire and its most wonderfully malevolent king. :::
- King: We must eliminate him, then. Such an inconvenience. Where is he? :::
- Old Hag: I do not know. This is something I cannot see; it seems as if the land itself were keeping him safe. :::
- King: Something must be done. :::
- Old Hag: As I’ve said, my sovereign, the land is not on our side, and our darkwood ears and eyes do not reach wherever he is. :::
- Old Hag: Time is running short. You must destroy him and any allies that may be rallying to him. I’m still trying to determine who and where his allies are, but it may take time. You must not wait. :::
- King: Do not underestimate the power of my army Old Hag. Our forces are unparalleled! Why even bother searching for him? Let him come to us. :::
- Old Hag: No. The land will guide him and his allies to us. The land mystifies even our darkwood eyes. By the time we’re aware of his presence, he and his allies will already be within Retsinis’ walls. :::
- King: And that could take years! We have too many other threats to worry about a small farm boy and his insignificant friends. I’m sure they’ll be overwhelmed before they even get remotely close to us. :::
- Old Hag: I urge you to reconsider. I have seen many things over my lifetime; I know when the land is preparing an assault. Now is not the time for overconfidence, my liege! :::
- King: Enough! We will not be destroyed by that ingrate! :::
- King: Even if he learns of his “destiny,” he could never become strong enough to reach us, yet alone fight through our defenses and our legions! No, we will worry about him when and if he tries to reach us. :::
- Old Hag: This is only the beginning. Already his friends are beginning to find their way toward him, their destinies soon to intertwine. He will not be alone. :::
- King: Then we’ll worry about them then as well. I say, you’ve been awfully skittish lately! Don’t I give you enough vacation? :::
- Old Hag: ... :::
- King: Thank you for the warning, Old Hag, but try not to worry. Either we’ll find him, or he’s already been destroyed. You may leave now. :::
- Old Hag: *sigh* :::
